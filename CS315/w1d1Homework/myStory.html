    <h3>My life story</h3>
    <p>It is Sunday, around 9:05 in the morning, on November 27, 1994. Somewhere in the Nord-East side
        of Romania, into a city called Suceava, next to the Ukraine’s border, a baby cried for the first time. It was
        the happiest moment for Lili and Ioan Paval: their only child was born, a healty and beautiful boy.</p>
    
    <p>Hello, my name is Stelica Dorinel Paval and I am that baby. Now, I have 27 years old and a very interesting
        life story to tell. My first years of life were spent in my hometown, being surrounded by my loved ones.
        Every summer break and any free time I had, I used to run around my grandparents and their animals.
        Being the only child brought me a lot of good things, but also some shortages, loneliness that I had to
        struggle with.</p> 
        <p>The fascinating thing is that in 2018, when I was getting ready to graduate from college, I came across the
            MIU website and I thought will be a really good opportunity for my career. Unfortunately, at that time I
            didn’t have two years of work experience, so I couldn’t apply for the master’s program. Four years later,
            here I am, a green card holder, so greateful to be part of this academic environment. I lost many friends
            because I decided to follow my dreams and move from one place to another, but I regret nothing. After
            all the ups and downs of my life, going through many good and bad times, I realized I am my best friend
            and I have to take care of myself and my consciousness. Because, at the end, this is all I truly have and
            what exactly matters.</p>
